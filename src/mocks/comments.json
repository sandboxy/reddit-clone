Here's my standard set of advice and resources for learning React:\n\nThe article \"A Study Plan to Cure Javascript Fatigue\" ( https://medium.freecodecamp.com/a-study-plan-to-cure-javascript-fatigue-8ad3a54f2eb1 ) is a great place to start. It gives an excellent series of steps for tackling modern Javascript concepts one piece at a time: Javascript, React, ES6, and state management.\n\nOn that note, definitely don't over-complicate the learning process by trying to learn many different things at once. Some people will say you should use a \"boilerplate\" to learn React, and they're wrong - boilerplate projects almost always come with too many pieces configured, and are confusing for beginners.\n\nInstead, the best advice is to focus on learning React itself first. Once you have a good understanding of how React works, you will better appreciate why a state management library like Redux can be useful, and you can learn about other tools later.\n\nYou should start out by reading through the official React docs and tutorial at https://facebook.github.io/react/, and I'd encourage you to use the official Create-React-App tool ( https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app ) for setting up projects. It creates a project with a solid build setup, with no configuration needed on your part. There's an excellent post called \"Simple React Development in 2017\" ( https://hackernoon.com/simple-react-development-in-2017-113bd563691f ) that gives some more specific instructions on the actual steps to follow.\n\nPast that, I keep a big list of links to high-quality tutorials and articles on React, Redux, and related topics, at https://github.com/markerikson/react-redux-links . Specifically intended to be a great starting point for anyone trying to learn the ecosystem, as well as a solid source of good info on more advanced topics. It includes links for learning core Javascript (ES5), modern Javascript (ES6+), React, and much more. I also published an \"Intro to React (and Redux)\" presentation at http://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/02/presentation-react-redux-intro/ , which is a good overview of the basic concepts for both React and Redux.\n\nFinally, the Reactiflux chat channels on Discord are a great place to hang out, ask questions, and learn. The invite link is at https://www.reactiflux.com .",

It gives an excellent series of steps for tackling modern Javascript concepts one piece at a time: Javascript, React, ES6, and state management.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On that note, definitely don&amp;#39;t over-complicate the learning process by trying to learn many different things at once. Some people will say you should use a &amp;quot;boilerplate&amp;quot; to learn React, and they&amp;#39;re wrong - boilerplate projects almost always come with too many pieces configured, and are confusing for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, the best advice is to focus on learning React itself first. Once you have a good understanding of how React works, you will better appreciate why a state management library like Redux can be useful, and you can learn about other tools later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You should start out by reading through the official React docs and tutorial at &lt;a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/\"&gt;https://facebook.github.io/react/&lt;/a&gt;, and I&amp;#39;d encourage you to use the official Create-React-App tool ( &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app\"&gt;https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app&lt;/a&gt; ) for setting up projects. It creates a project with a solid build setup, with no configuration needed on your part. There&amp;#39;s an excellent post called &amp;quot;Simple React Development in 2017&amp;quot; ( &lt;a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/simple-react-development-in-2017-113bd563691f\"&gt;https://hackernoon.com/simple-react-development-in-2017-113bd563691f&lt;/a&gt; ) that gives some more specific instructions on the actual steps to follow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Past that, I keep a big list of links to high-quality tutorials and articles on React, Redux, and related topics, at &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/markerikson/react-redux-links\"&gt;https://github.com/markerikson/react-redux-links&lt;/a&gt; . Specifically intended to be a great starting point for anyone trying to learn the ecosystem, as well as a solid source of good info on more advanced topics. It includes links for learning core Javascript (ES5), modern Javascript (ES6+), React, and much more. I also published an &amp;quot;Intro to React (and Redux)&amp;quot; presentation at &lt;a href=\"http://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/02/presentation-react-redux-intro/\"&gt;http://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/02/presentation-react-redux-intro/&lt;/a&gt; , which is a good overview of the basic concepts for both React and Redux.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, the Reactiflux chat channels on Discord are a great place to hang out, ask questions, and learn. The invite link is at &lt;a href=\"https://www.reactiflux.com\"&gt;https://www.reactiflux.com&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
